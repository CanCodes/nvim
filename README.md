# Nvim Config
This repository has the nvim configuration of [CanCodes](https://github.com/cancodes)

## Setup
Clone the repository to your nvim configuration folder, and open nvim. It will automatically install all the necessary tools and you will be ready to go.

## How?
I wanted to use vim for a month (Jan 2024) and I followed the tutorial by ThePrimeagen on YouTube [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)
